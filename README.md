# ðŸš† Train Project

This project is a C-based simulation of basic train operations, including wagon assignment, cargo management, and system status tracking. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as file operations, modular code organization, and terminal-based user interaction.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Wagon Allocation** â€“ Assigns wagons to trains based on availability and compatibility.
- **Cargo Handling** â€“ Supports loading and unloading materials from wagons.
- **Status Tracking** â€“ Displays the current state of all trains and wagons.
- **File I/O** â€“ Reads from and writes to external `.txt` files to simulate data persistence.
- **Modular Structure** â€“ Organized source files with clear separation of concerns.
- **Console Menu** â€“ Simple, user-friendly terminal interface for interacting with the system.
